# ðŸ›’ Blinkit Grocery Sales Dashboard

## Overview
This Power BI project analyzes **Blinkitâ€™s grocery sales data** to understand how different factors such as item type, fat content, outlet size, and location affect sales and customer ratings. The dashboard provides an overview of sales performance across multiple outlets, helping to identify top-performing product categories and outlet types.

This project was developed as part of my **Data Analytics course** to gain hands-on experience in building interactive dashboards and uncovering business insights using **Power BI**.
